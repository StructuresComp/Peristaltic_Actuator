# Bio-Inspired Modular Pneumatic Actuator for Peristaltic Transport

## Overview

This projects introduces a bio-inspired soft robotic actuator for object transport through tubular structures. Simulations and experiments show optimal performance with objects larger than half the ring's inner diameter, enabling efficient, modular solutions for diverse applications.
